# Sales-Management-system

Problem Definition:
Small scale grocery stores run their business activities vulnerably and records are
maintained manually. In consequence, the stores are suffering from many problems
such as no proper documentation of the available product, if customer demand for
particular product shopkeepers manually needs to check the storehouse, having no
idea of the available stock. In these worst-cases complexities is high. Overall the traditional approach had caused damage to the extension of the business. Hence, we as
a helping hand decided to automate/computerize the Sales Management Information
System where the Product information, Purchase information, Billing history, etc.
are to be computerized to improve the performance of the store from better access to
information.
We desired to automate the following information services:
        i. Product/Item stock reserved information.
        ii. Bill generated for each purchase with number and date.
        iii. Purchase backlog information with the date.
        iv. Managing product list with adding, modifying, and deleting the items as per
        the stock modification.
